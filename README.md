# Regression-Models-with-Optimization-Techniques-ML
The objective of the Project is to predict the Irreducible Water Saturation
(Swirr) for each sample of Core_Swi_23 data using different
regression models. Since Swirr is difficult to measure, we
will use data-driven approaches to build models that can
accurately predict it.
